                    </p>
                    <p class='titles'>General Manager | Chief Executive Officer</p>
                    <p>After being brought on board in S31, the winds of change quickly followed.  A father of three (Ben, Ethan, and Oskar), a business man, and an avid sports nut, Kyle Wahlters has never held his vision in a way that prevents others from seeing potential change.</p>
                    <p><br></p>
                    <p>Born in 1984, he was the oldest of six siblings and grew up in the tundra known as Madison, WI.  Always one more towards the educational route, Wahlters graduated from the University of Wisconsin Business School.  He quickly took the route of a flourishing entrepreneur and owned multiple businesses while servicing many local manufacturing companies as an advisor to digital breaking marketing trends.</p>
                    <p><br></p>
                    <p>It wasn't until his oldest, Ben Waters, was drafted into the SMJHL that Kyle took an interest in the SHL itself.  As the S31 SHL Draft came and went, Ben was on his way to Hamilton while Kyle would be heading to Portland.</p>
                    <p><br></p>
                    <p>With the Portland community unknowing of what outspoken change meant for their organization, Kyle came in and would set a new bar for team highs and help lead many players to establish individual records... while still falling short of the playoffs.  As the inaugural season came to an end, Wahlters put the league on notice that change was on the horizon after unloading Portland's top three players and inciting yet another rebuild.</p>
                    <p><br></p>
                    <p>Fans all over the map feel that this time was for real.  After going from the best to worst season, it is hard to imagine so... But with stocked talent, veteran leadership and a rebranding focus, all Wahlters has preached to this point has come to fruition, but now the time comes for wins to follow suit.</p>
                    <p><br></p>
                    <p>"It isn't up to whether the league believes Portland is here to stay for good... I personally couldn't care less who doesn't think our route to this very point is a path that should or shouldn't have been taken.  The proof is on the ice and in that locker room... If we don't perform then we aren't doing our job.  This is an organization that will create a rich history and will be perennial championship contenders for years to come." - Kyle Wahlters</p>

                            <img src='../img/hazard.jpg'></div><span class='name'>M.W. Hazard</span></p> 
                    <p class='titles'>Assistant General Manager | Executive Director of Player Personnel</p>
                    <p>Serving as Wahlters' right hand man is M.W. Hazard, often referred to by those in the organization simply as "Haz". Hazard is a longtime hockey fanatic with a passion for following player development and scouting. A native of the Pacific Northwest, Hazard has been a part of numerous successful restaurant ventures in the Portland metropolitan area, both as an entrepreneur and a culinary advisor. When the opportunity to get involved with the Admirals management opened, Hazard eagerly pursued the opportunity and a partnership was born.</p>
                    <p><br></p>
                    <p>Hazard brings his experience from both the business world and the culinary world to the table coupled with his love of all things hockey, drawing on his Economics degree from Reed College and his penchant for the blend of quantitative and qualitative skills necessary in the world of sports management. Since being brought on ahead of S32, Hazard has become the Executive Director of Player Personnel in addition to Assistant General Manager.</p>
                    <p><br></p>
                    <p>"The Admirals are the future of the SHL. I really believe that this organization has shaken the growing pains of being an expansion franchise. It's been a labor of love. I'm a lucky guy- I now get to pursue my passion for this game after getting to pursue my passion for the culinary arts for quite some time. Rose City, this is your fleet." - M.W. Hazard</p>

                            <img src='../img/tanner.jpg'></div><span class='name'>Jakob Tanner</span></p> 
                    <p class='titles'>Head Coach | Player Development Coordinator</p>
                    <p>In only his third season after being drafted, Jakob Tanner found himself at the helm of the Hamilton Steelhawks following a scandal that ousted the previous management. Young and woefully unprepared, Tanner nonetheless managed to usher in a new era of prosperity for the Hamilton franchise. His second season as general manager ended with him hoisting the Challenge Cup overhead, ending a 12-season Cup drought for the Steelhawks. Just two seasons later, they would win again. In season 31, he was inducted into the SHL Hall of Fame as a general manager.</p>
                    <p><br></p>
                    <p>Following his departure from a management position within the Steelhawks organization, Tanner continued to find individual success. After one more season in Hamilton, he was traded to the New England Wolfpack, where he won consecutive championships in the two seasons he spent with the team. Retiring after his fourth Cup, he left the game as arguably the best goaltender in the history of the league. His last postseason saw him break the league record for career playoff wins, as well as established him as the first and only goaltender to win four Challenge Cups in his career.</p>
                    <p><br></p>
                    <p>Tanner was hired as Head Coach by the Portland Admirals in the offseason prior to season 33, a move that further strengthened the Portland management team. Acting in tandem with Wahlters and Hazard, he hopes to take the Admirals' talented young core and help bring them to the first championship win in franchise history.</p>
                    <p><br></p>
                    <p>"I've been extremely impressed with both Wahlters and Hazard in my time negotiating with them, and in our discussions regarding the future of the franchise. Many may be counting us out due to the team's performance in recent years, but I'm confident. A new era is dawning in Portland, and it's going to take the league by storm." - Jakob Tanner</p>
