                        The Portland Admirals
                    </div>
                    <div class='body-text'><p>The Portland Admirals were one of two teams to be brought into the Simulation Hockey League in S25, bringing the total number of teams in the league to fourteen. Early stars included Nikolaus Scholz, still playing for the Edmonton Blizzard, and one Buster "Buzz" Killington, for whom the Admirals Team MVP trophy is named. Over time the team enjoyed racuous support at the Rose Garden (later renamed to the Moda Center) but still were left searching for their first playoff appearance. Management changed over after turbulent times, but recent history bodes well for the still young franchise. After S31, a massive overhaul was undertaken to bring you the team you see today.</p>

                    <p>Taking over after Head GM Cuffy stepped down, Kyle Wahlters initiated a drastic redesign of the team's construction and image. While retaining the same cherished look the team has had since it's inception, the Admirals sent away veterans such as Don Pellegrino and Maximilian Wachter and brought in a massive wave of young talent. Wahlters also went out and got his right-hand man, hiring local restaurant icon and Admirals superfan M.W. Hazard as his Assistant General Manager. The Admirals fielded a very young roster in S32 with plenty of talent developing in the SMJHL and fought valiantly in a season they were clearly outmatched. This season has brought plenty of excitement as many star prospects get the call to the SHL, with the addition of a trio of star veterans in the offseason.</p>

                    <p>The fleet sets sail on a new chapter in their journey. Come Hell or High Water, it's Anchors Away for your PORTLAND ADMIRALS!</p></div>
